# Noise-Detection-System
In this project I aim to develop an IOT based device that can be used to monitor or manage noise
pollution. The prepared device can then be further tuned to use at any point of interests like schools,
hospitals, zoo, library and any other place that requires monitoring. The produced data can be used
to keep track of misuse of human power and energy. The noise detection system (NDS) is
specifically designed to monitor noise produced by the machines, transports and humans
themselves. The NDS will be useful in places such as school classrooms, hospitals, church and any
worshiping temple or any place where noise or loud sounds are undesirable. It will help the security
and maintenance staff at such places to monitor the work place. The system will also keep the
record of the data generated by the system and can be reviewed any time by the managing
authorities.
